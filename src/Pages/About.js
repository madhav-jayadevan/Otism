              Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects individuals' social interaction, communication, and behavior. It is a lifelong condition that typically becomes apparent during early childhood. People with autism may have difficulty with social skills, such as making eye contact, understanding nonverbal cues, and engaging in reciprocal conversation. They may also exhibit repetitive behaviors or intense interests in specific topics. It is important to understand that autism is a spectrum, which means that individuals with autism can vary widely in their strengths, challenges, and support needs. Each person with autism is unique, with their own abilities and potential for growth. Acceptance, empathy, and inclusion are crucial in creating a supportive and inclusive environment for individuals with autism, promoting their well-being and helping them thrive. Education and awareness play a vital role in dispelling misconceptions and fostering understanding about autism, enabling society to embrace neurodiversity and celebrate the unique strengths and contributions of individuals on the autism spectrum.
